# Mode With VBA
Using vba to find the mode of a data set by placing the data into bins.

The excel file contains a sample stock data set and the VBA macro.

The program first creates the bins based on the number of total bins selected by the user. The default value is 20. Then the program looks at each data point and increments a bin counter array to count the number of variables in each bin. Once the data set has been fully examined a loop is used to find the bin with the most number of data points and a mesage box displays the bin and the number of data points.
